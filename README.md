# Rigid
Rigid is a command-line tool that will completely eliminate misspelled string literals from your projects and your life.

# How is This Done?
Rigid will automatically scan your Xcode project and generate `.swift` file with typed constants for commonly used string literals like image file names, Nib names, `UIViewController` storyboard identifier, and more.
